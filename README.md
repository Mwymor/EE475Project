## What is Wella?
The goal of Wella is to improve the experience of using an umbrella and provide ​a personal weather station for each of it's users.  
What makes Wella different than current weather app solutions is that it will provide real-time weather updates by using crowd-sourced data rather than predictive algorithms.  
Wella will provide it's users with data about temperature, humidity, sunlight intensity, and rain intensity.  
The App connected to the Wella will provide this information along with a dynamic map showing accurate pins where other Wella users are using the device.  
Lastly, you will never lose your Wella because it is connected via bluetooth to your device and will notify you if you get too far away.

Wella uses an esp-32 as the microcontroller for its various sensors.  This repo contains the code for both the microcontroller
firmware, and the andriod application.
